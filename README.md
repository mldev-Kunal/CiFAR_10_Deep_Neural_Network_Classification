# CiFAR_10_Deep_Neural_Network_Classification

The dataset stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR).

CIFAR-10 is widely used for machine learning and computer vision applications.

CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of several images divided into the following 10 classes: 

Airplanes, Cars, Birds, Cats, Deer, Dogs, Frogs, Horses, Ships, Trucks.

The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images, 6,000 images of each class.

NOTE-Images have low resolution (32x32) for computationally efficient.
